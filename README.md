## Features

Sdk-py include the methods to make easy the connection with contracts deployed in different networks.
This repository include also the methods to encrypt and decrypt information using the Parity Secret Store.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.6

## Quick-start

Install sdk:

```
pip install nevermined-sdk-py
```

### Usage:

```python
import os
import time

from nevermined_sdk_py import (
    Nevermined,
    ConfigProvider,
    Config,
    Metadata,
    Account
)

ConfigProvider.set_config(Config('config.ini'))
# Make a new instance of Nevermined
nevermined = Nevermined() # or Nevermined(Config('config.ini'))
config = nevermined.config
# make account instance, assuming the ethereum account and password are set 
# in the config file `config.ini`
account = nevermined.accounts.list()[0]
# or 
account = Account(config.parity_address, config.parity_password)

# PUBLISHER
# Let's start by registering an asset in the Nevermined network
metadata = Metadata.get_example()

# access and service endpoints require `gateway.url` is set in the config file
# or passed to Nevermined instance in the config_dict.
# define the services to include in the new asset DDO

ddo = nevermined.assets.create(metadata, account)

# Now we have an asset registered, we can verify it exists by resolving the did
_ddo = nevermined.assets.resolve(ddo.did)
# ddo and _ddo should be identical

# CONSUMER
# search for assets
asset_ddo = nevermined.assets.search('Nevermined protocol')[0]
# Need some ocean tokens to be able to order assets
nevermined.accounts.request_tokens(account, 10)

# Start the purchase/access request. This will automatically make a payment from the specified account.
consumer_account = nevermined.accounts.list()[1]
service_agreement_id = nevermined.assets.order(asset_ddo.did, 0, consumer_account)

# after a short wait (seconds to minutes) the asset data files should be available in the `downloads.path` defined in config
# wait a bit to let things happen
time.sleep(20)

# Asset files are saved in a folder named after the asset id
dataset_dir = os.path.join(nevermined.config.downloads_path, f'datafile.{asset_ddo.asset_id}.0')
if os.path.exists(dataset_dir):
    print('asset files downloaded: {}'.format(os.listdir(dataset_dir)))

```

## Configuration

```python
config_dict = {
    'keeper-contracts': {
        # Point to an Ethereum RPC client. Note that sdk learns the name of the network to work with from this client.
        'keeper.url': 'http://localhost:8545',
        # Specify the keeper contracts artifacts folder (has the smart contracts definitions json files). When you
        # install the package, the artifacts are automatically picked up from the `keeper-contracts` Python
        # dependency unless you are using a local ethereum network.
        'keeper.path': 'artifacts',
        'secret_store.url': 'http://localhost:12001',
        'parity.url': 'http://localhost:8545',
        'parity.address': '',
        'parity.password': '',

    },
    'resources': {
        # Metadata is the metadata store. It stores the assets DDO/DID-document
        'metadata.url': 'http://localhost:5000',
        # Gateway is the publisher's agent. It serves purchase and requests for both data access and compute services
        'gateway.url': 'http://localhost:8030',
        # points to the local database file used for storing temporary information (for instance, pending service agreements).
        'storage.path': 'sdk.db',
        # Where to store downloaded asset files
        'downloads.path': 'access-downloads'
    }
}

```

In addition to the configuration file, you may use the following environment variables (override the corresponding configuration file values):

- KEEPER_PATH
- KEEPER_URL
- GAS_LIMIT
- METADATA_URL

## Development

1. Set up a virtual environment

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv -p python3.6
    source venv/bin/activate 
    ```

1. Install requirements

    ```
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    ```

1. Create the local testing environment using [nevermined-tools](https://github.com/nevermined-io/tools). Once cloned that repository, you can start the cluster running:

    ```
    ./start_nevermined.sh --latest --no-gateway --no-common --local-spree-node
    ```

    It runs a Nevermined Metadata node and an Ethereum RPC client. For details, read `docker-compose.yml`.

1. Create local configuration file

    ```
    cp config.ini config_local.ini
    ```

   `config_local.ini` is used by unit tests.

1. Copy keeper artifacts

    A bash script is available to copy keeper artifacts into this file directly from a running docker image. This script needs to run in the root of the project.
    The script waits until the keeper contracts are deployed, and then copies the artifacts.

    ```
    ./scripts/wait_for_migration_and_extract_keeper_artifacts.sh
    ```

    The artifacts contain the addresses of all the deployed contracts and their ABI definitions required to interact with them.


#### Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Github actions
Our test use pytest framework.
